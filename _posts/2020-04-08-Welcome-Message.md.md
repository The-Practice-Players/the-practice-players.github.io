Welcome to **The Practice Players**.

An interactive, opinionated, sports environment fostering family-friendly collaborative content.

**The Practice Players** was created to envelop a passion for sports with dialogue, where opinions are always welcomed.

Origination of the name comes from a common phrase mentioned in sports, although perhaps in a more negative light. “Practice Players” are usually referred to as those who either shine when the spotlights aren’t on them, the average Joes, or those who aren’t the “elite stars”. However **The Practice Players** sports environment was created for the average sports fan who loves to talk sports, plain and simple.

Content for this site will be posted on this website, Instagram (@practiceplayers), Twitter (@practiceplayers), Facebook (@practiceplayers) and YouTube pages.
